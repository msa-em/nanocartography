      With the increasing diversity in material systems, ever-expanding number
      of analysis techniques, and the large capital costs of next generation
      instruments the ability to quickly and efficiently collect data in the
      electron microscope has become paramount to successful data analysis.
      Therefore, this research proposes a methodology of nanocartography that
      combines predictive stage motion with crystallographic information to
      provide microscopists with a sample map that can both reduce analysis
      time and improve confidence in data collected. Having a road map of the
      stage positions linked to microstructural (e.g., interfaces and growing
      directions) and crystallographic orientation data (e.g., specific poles
      and planes) provides microscopists with the ability to solve orientation
      relationships, create oblique tilt series movies, and also solve complex
      crystallographic unknowns at extremely small scales with minimal
      information. Most importantly, it can convert any sample orientation
      relationships across microscopes to increase optimization and
      collaboration throughout the field.
