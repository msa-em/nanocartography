With the increasing diversity in material systems, ever-expanding number
of analysis techniques, and the large capital costs of next generation
instruments the ability to quickly and efficiently collect data in the
electron microscope has become paramount to successful data analysis.
Therefore, this research proposes a methodology of nanocartography that
combines predictive stage motion with crystallographic information to
provide microscopists with a sample map that can both reduce analysis
time and improve confidence in data collected. Having a road map of the
stage positions linked to microstructural (e.g., interfaces and growing
directions) and crystallographic orientation data (e.g., specific poles
and planes) provides microscopists with the ability to solve orientation
relationships, create oblique tilt series movies, and also solve complex
crystallographic unknowns at extremely small scales with minimal
information. Most importantly, it can convert any sample orientation
relationships across microscopes to increase optimization and
collaboration throughout the field.
